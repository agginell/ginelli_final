			<h2> Allegheny County Navigates the Drug Crisis Post-COVID-19 </h2>
			<h4> How Allegheny County is combatting the opioid epidemic in a post-pandemic world<br>By Anna Ginelli</h4>
		</section> 
		<section>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<img src="narcan.png" alt="Narcan" height=200 px width=300 px>
			<p>Drug overdose deaths have consistently been a cause of injury-related deaths in the United States. Deaths involving synthetic opioids and stimulants have been increasing rapidly in recent years. The severity of the issue has only worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
			<br> 
			Allegheny County, which is located in Western Pennsylvania, is not immune to the devastating effects of the drug overdose crisis. The city of Pittsburgh sits within the county lines, and the county’s urban landscape has suffered its share of fatal overdoses. But, health officials are working diligently to mitigate the number of lives lost to the drug epidemic.</p>
		<section>
			<h3>Identifying the Crisis</h3>

			<iframe title="Allegheny County experiences rapid decrease in accidental overdose deaths after Narcan becomes more accessible" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-2nO0v" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2nO0v/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; margin-left: 5%;border: none;" height="383"></iframe></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
	
			<p>From 2015 to 2017, Allegheny County experienced a nearly 75% increase in fatal accidental overdose deaths. Neil Ruhland, the Allegheny County Health Department Public Information Officer, noted that this dramatic increase was due to the introduction of synthetic street drugs around this time.<br> 
			<br> 
			“Around 2015, we saw a rapid transition to a street-level drug composition that favored fentanyl over heroin. It’s stronger, so it’s more profitable to sell and easier to smuggle,” Ruhland said. “If a person who was using heroin didn’t know they were getting product orders of a magnitude stronger than they were used to, the likelihood of overdose skyrockets as well.”<br> 
			<br> 
			After reaching a decade high in fatal accidental overdoses in 2017 with 732 overdoses, The Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) shifted its focus to informing the public about ways to combat the drug epidemic on an individual level, according to Ruhland.<br> 
			<br> 
			“The ACHD has focused on community education about the nature of the rapidly changing illicit drug market, how to spot an overdose, and what to do in case of an overdose,” Ruhland said.<br> 
			<br>   
			More specifically, the county has adopted community resources including <strong><a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Overdose-Prevention/Naloxone-Information.aspx" target="_blank">Narcan (naloxone) distribution</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Overdose-Prevention/Opioid-Resources-and-FAQ.aspx" target="_blank">education and support resources</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.pppgh.org/" target="_blank">syringe exchange sites</a></strong>.<br> 
			<br> 
			In an interview with <strong><a href="https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2022-07-08/overdose-deaths-rise-in-allegheny-county-for-the-third-straight-year" target="_blank">90.5 WESA</a></strong>, Dr. Karl Williams, the chief medical examiner for Allegheny County, said that the decrease in overdose deaths after 2017 was due to Narcan being made available at pharmacies without a prescription from a doctor.<br> 
			<br> 
			“All of these drugs have been known since the 70s, so they aren’t new drugs. They’re just now being manufactured more radically,” Williams said.<br> 
			<br> 
			Williams also shared that overdose deaths account for more than a quarter of all cases investigated by his office. To directly address this concern, the ACHD’s overdose prevention program helped distribute more than 18,000 doses of Narcan.</p>

			<h3>Racial Inequities</h3>
			<p>Aside from implementing resources, Ruhland says that the ACHD is focused on helping high-need communities, such as communities of color, unhoused populations, and other groups of people who have a high level of risk and a high level of need that have been previously unmet.</p>

			<iframe title="In Allegheny County, Black residents are hardest hit by overdose deaths, data shows " aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-DTWea" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DTWea/4/" s scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; margin-left: 5%;border: none;" height="383"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

		<p>According to the above graph, Black individuals are the racial group that is most affected by fatal accidental overdoses. The data is consistent with national data from the <strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/01/19/recent-surge-in-u-s-drug-overdose-deaths-has-hit-black-men-the-hardest/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a></strong>, which identified Black men as the demographic group most at risk for dying of a drug overdose.<br> 
		<br> 
		On August 31, 2021, former Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto issued an <strong><a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15559_EO_Final_Fentanyl.pdf" target="_blank">executive order</a></strong> to encourage the use of fentanyl test strips in honor of Overdose Awareness Day. In the order, the mayor acknowledges the severity of overdose deaths in Pittsburgh and calls attention to racial inequity issues in terms of the opioid epidemic.<br> 
		<br> 
		“The rate of overdose mortality for Black residents of Allegheny County is significantly high than that of White residents, thereby deepening racial inequity,” Peduto wrote. “Black men experienced a 200% increase in overdose deaths from Quarter 3 of 2019 to Quarter 2 of 2020 compared with the data from Quarter 3 of 2018 to Quarter 2 of 2019.”</p>

		<h3>The Universities' Response</h3>
		<p>Allegheny County is home to <strong><a href="https://www.countyoffice.org/pa-allegheny-county-colleges/" target="_blank">58 colleges</a></strong>, including the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. Because of the exposure to party culture and drugs in college, college students are considered a high-risk group in terms of the opioid epidemic.<br>
		<br>
		According to the <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7500461/" target="_blank">2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a></strong> (NSDUH), 1 in 4 young adults aged 18 to 25 were current illicit drug users, primarily using marijuana and opioids. The study identified college students as a “crucial age group with exposure to opioid pain relievers and potentially adverse consequences”.<br>
		<br>
		Ruhland said that although college students are at a higher risk of overdosing, universities often have resources allocated to the students as well as healthcare included in their tuition. The ACHD also collaborates with the major universities in the county to push harm reduction initiatives, education, community trainings, and networking to build programs.<br>
		<br>
		In 2016, the University of Pittsburgh Institute of Politics came out with a <strong><a href="http://iop.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Reports/Status_Reports/A%20Continuum%20of%20Care%20Approach%20-%20Western%20Pennsylvania%27s%20Response%20to%20the%20Opioid%20Epidemic.pdf" target="_blank">comprehensive research plan</a></strong> on the opioid crisis called <i>A Continuum of Care Approach: Western Pennsylvania’s Response to the Opioid Epidemic</i>.<br>
		<br>
		In the plan, researchers identified the problem, initiatives that the county implemented, and further recommendations. Many of the recommendations, such as syringe exchange sites, are successfully used today.</p>

		<h3> A Continuous Effort </h3>
		<p>Though Allegheny County has been largely successful in combatting fatal accidental overdoses in recent years, Ruhland said that the ACHD is far from finishing their work.<br>
		<br>
		“The ACHD recognizes that preventing substance use entirely is an impossible mission, and not one that we could never achieve,” Ruhland said. “Rather, we focus on preventing fatal overdoses, building community programs to improve access to care and treatment, and helping improve the community in ways that make the escape that substance use provides less necessary for individuals.”</p>
